# nigerian-or-japanese
A quick quiz that asks: Can you tell which these sixteen names are Nigerian, and which are Japanese?

Inspired by this YouTube Short: https://youtube.com/shorts/dA8o44DnGL0
Names collected from Wikipedia.

All names could theoretically follow Japanese phonology; there are no invalid morae like in "**Si**kiru O**di**naka", "**ti**ramisu", "ro**tu**nda", "ba**lala**ika", "chi**hu**a**hu**a", etc.
